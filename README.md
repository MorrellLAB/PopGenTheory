# PopGenTheory Discussion Group

Meeting times are **Mondays from 3:30-4:30 pm CT (1:30-2:30 pm PT)** in 409 Borlaug Hall (UMN) or Bio Sci 3622 (UCI). You can also join remotely via Zoom meeting ID 658-235-858 or [join URL](https://umn.zoom.us/j/658235858).

### What is this discussion group?

- Informal discussion centered on Population Genetics, Evolutionary Genetics, and Quantitative Genetics theory
- Focused on reading relevant books, classic literature, understanding modern tools and their applications, and interpretating results

### General Plan

We will discuss [*Statistical Population Genomics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-0716-0199-0) this spring. Please see below for a more detailed schedule.
