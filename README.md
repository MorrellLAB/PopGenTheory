### What is this discussion group?

- Informal discussion centered on Population Genetics, Evolutionary Genetics, and Quantitative Genetics theory
- Focused on reading relevant books, classic literature, understanding modern tools and their applications, and interpretating results

### General Plan

We will discuss [*Statistical Population Genomics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-0716-0199-0) this spring. Please see below for a more detailed schedule.
