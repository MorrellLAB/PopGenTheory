# PopGenTheory Discussion Group

Meeting times are **Fridays from 1:30 PM-2:30 PM**. We will be meeting via Zoom Video but can reserve a room if needed.

### What is this discussion group?
- Informal discussion centered on Population Genetics, Evolutionary Genetics, and Quantitative Genetics Theory
- Focused on reading relevant books, classic literature, understanding modern tools and their applications, and interpretating results

### General Plan

We will discuss [*Breeding for Quantitative Traits in Plants* by Rex Bernardo](http://stemmapress.com/) this fall. Please see below for a more detailed schedule.
