# PopGenTheory Discussion Group

Meeting times are **Tuesdays from 11:00 AM-12:00 PM** in 409 Borlaug Hall.

### What is this discussion group?
- Informal discussion centered on Population Genetics and Evolutionary Genetics Theory
- Focused on reading relevant books, classic literature, understanding modern tools and their applications, and interpretating results

### General Plan

The first 4 weeks, we will focus on PopGen basics and read through [Graham Coop's book on Population Genetics](https://github.com/cooplab/popgen-notes/blob/master/popgen_notes.pdf) two chapters per week. After that, we will work through [Matthew Hahn's Molecular Population Genetics book](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/molecular-population-genetics-9780878939657?cc=us&lang=en&) one chapter per week. Please see schedule below.
