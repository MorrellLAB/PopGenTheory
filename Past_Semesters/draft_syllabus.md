# Population Genetics Discussion Syllabus

In an effort to expand our knowledge of the field of population genetics and evolutionary genetics theory, we have started this [PopGenTheory](https://github.com/MorrellLAB/PopGenTheory/blob/master/README.md) discussion group. To give the discussion structure, we have set some long term goals and drafted up a syllabus of topics we want to cover. The content will be added as we go along.

Here are some long term goals for the discussion:

- Strengthen foundation - population genetics & evolutionary genetics theory
- Explore & understand applications of commonly used tools
- Develop an ability to analyze and interpret results
